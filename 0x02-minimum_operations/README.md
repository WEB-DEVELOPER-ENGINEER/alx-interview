+ [x] 0. **Minimum Operations**<br/>[0-minoperations.py](0-minoperations.py) contains a function `def minOperations(n):` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a file that contains a single character H. The text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste.
  + Returns: `integer` representing the number of minimum operations to result in exactly n H characters, and 0 if n is impossible to achieve.
