### This repository contains several projects, each of which includes one or more tasks that I worked on to enhance my technical interview preparation

## Projects To Complete
+ [x] 0x00. **Pascal's Triangle**<br/>[0x00-pascal_triangle](0x00-pascal_triangle)
	- **Description**: This project involves working with Pascal's Triangle and implementing a Python script to generate rows of Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.
	- **Files**: [0-pascal_triangle.py](0x00-pascal_triangle/0-pascal_triangle.py)
+ [x] 0x01. **Lockboxes**<br/>[0x01-lockboxes](0x01-lockboxes)
	- **Description**: This project involves solving the problem of determining whether all locked boxes can be opened. You are given a list of boxes, each containing keys that may unlock other boxes. The goal is to implement a Python script that checks if it's possible to unlock all the boxes.
	- **Files**: [0-lockboxes.py](0x01-lockboxes/0-lockboxes.py)
+ [x] 0x02. **Minimum Operations**<br/>[0x02-minimum_operations](0x02-minimum_operations)
	- **Description**: This project involves solving the problem of calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a text file that contains a single character H. The text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste.
	- **Files**: [0-minoperations.py](0x02-minimum_operations/0-minoperations.py)
