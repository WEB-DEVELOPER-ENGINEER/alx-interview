# Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number Algorithm

This algorithm efficiently calculates the last digit of a large Fibonacci number by employing the following strategies:

## 1. Integer Overflow Prevention
To prevent integer overflow, the algorithm utilizes the modulo operation. The Fibonacci sequence exhibits a unique characteristic: the last digit of each consecutive term creates a sequence that repeats itself every 60 terms. Modulo operation ensures that the algorithm works with smaller values, preventing overflow issues.

## 2. Efficiency Enhancement
Performing arithmetic operations with smaller numbers is generally faster than with large numbers. The modulo operation enables the algorithm to work with smaller values, thereby improving efficiency.

## 3. Matrix Optimization
The algorithm leverages matrices to calculate very large Fibonacci numbers, optimizing the runtime to `O(n) = log(n)`.

## Development Insights
This solution was developed by applying some rules of thumb when designing an algorithm, including:

### a. Identify Problem Characteristics
Notice characteristics about the problem to devise a better algorithm that makes use of them. In this case, recognizing the ability to use matrices to solve Fibonacci problems and the cyclic nature of the last digit every 60 terms led to an optimized solution.
